## 90 day of devops Learing Plan

## I am a filnal year student / Fresher 

## Devops is culture and mind set of practices that combine deveplopment and oprations to deliver software faster , more reliably and at scale using automation, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring and insfrasturcture.

## cloud Engineering focuses on designing , deploying, securing, and managing scalable infrastructure on cloude plateforms like AWS

## Devops + cloud together enable orgnizations to build, ship and oiprate applications efficiently.


## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud 
- I enjoy workinf on automation, infractructure, and deployment pipelines.
- Devops engineers are in high demand with strong career growth.
- I want to move beyond only writing code and understand how system run in productions.
- My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled Cloud/Devops Engineer working on large-scale systems.

##  Where I WAnt to Reach (90-Day Goals)
1. Build and deploy a production-grade application using Docker, CI/CD and Kubernetes.
2. Become confident in Linux troubleshooting, Git workflow, and cloud fundamentals.
3. be job-ready for a Junior DevOps / Cloud Engineer roles.

 ## Core DevOps Skills I will Build
 1. Linux & Networking Fundamentals
 2. CI/CD Pipelines & Automations
 3. Containers, Kubernetes & Cloud AWS

## 90-Day High-Level Roadmap

 ## Weekly Time Commitment

- Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours per day  
- Weekends: 4–6 hours per day  
- Total: ~18–22 hours per week
  
# How I Will Stay Consistent

- Study at the same time daily  
- Maintain notes and GitHub repo  
- Build at least one small lab/project per week  
- Share progress publicly (#90DaysOfDevOps)  
- Review weekly and adjust plan if needed

## Promise to Myself
I commit to showing up every day, even on low-motivation days.  
Consistency > Motivation.
